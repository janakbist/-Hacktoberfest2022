Contribution RulesðŸ“š:
You are allowed to make pull requests. We just merge it ;)

Do NOT remove other content.
Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works
Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts

Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}
An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.


git remote add upstream https://github.com/janakbist/-Hacktoberfest2023.git
You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing


git remote -v
To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run


git merge upstream/master
